Can I explain what my code does?
    The code for this assignment uses HTML, and the final result is a resume webpage. The code includes the complete HTML structure: a header, footer, and body. The body section consists of three sections: Contact Information, About Me, and Skills, which introduce me.

What was my coding process?
    I first completed the structure of the entire webpage, then added text content. Finally, I added images and links, and adapted them to ARIA.

What challenges did I have?

    I didn't encounter any difficulties throughout the assignment because I had almost learned how to use HTML to make simple web pages from the demos and activities in class, but I did some searching on Google when adding the Aria function to the web page.

What would I do differently now?

    I probably won’t make any major changes. Maybe I’ll add more sections to the page, which is not necessary but will give the entire website more content to view.
